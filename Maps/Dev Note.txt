All map files downloaded through this script are brought to this folder. Then the .udk file is renamed to .upk
and moved into your "rocketleague\TAGame\CookedPCConsole" where either a "mods" or "rocketplugin" folder is 
added to store all the .upk files. This folder only stores the rest of the map files that aren't required.

Do not manually install maps by adding them to this folder. Just run the script each time you want to 
add a new map.
